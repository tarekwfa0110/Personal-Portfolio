                    I am a front-end developer based in Sydney looking for exciting opportunities. Has
                    Mechanical Engineering background. Likes to focus on accessibility when developing.
                    Passionate and curious about solving problems. Currently, Iâ€™m exploring Reactjs, Webflow
                    and a bit of Designing. While I am not programming, I enjoy playing football, photography
                    and playing Valorant. Learning more to improve skill.
